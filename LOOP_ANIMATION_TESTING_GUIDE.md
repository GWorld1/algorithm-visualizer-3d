# Loop Animation Step Generation - Testing Guide

## üéØ **Testing Objective**
Verify that the visual scripting system now correctly generates animation steps for each loop iteration, showing individual array access operations within loop bodies.

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Basic Loop with Array Access**
**Setup:**
- Start node ‚Üí For Loop (0 to 3) ‚Üí Array Access ‚Üí End node
- Connect loop index output to array access index input
- Test array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

**Expected Results:**
```
1. Starting algorithm execution
2. Starting loop: i = 0 to 3
3. Loop iteration 0: i = 0
4. Accessed array[0] = 10 (Loop iteration 0: i = 0)
5. Completed loop body for i = 0
6. Loop iteration 1: i = 1
7. Accessed array[1] = 20 (Loop iteration 1: i = 1)
8. Completed loop body for i = 1
9. Loop iteration 2: i = 2
10. Accessed array[2] = 30 (Loop iteration 2: i = 2)
11. Completed loop body for i = 2
12. Loop completed: processed 3 iterations
13. Algorithm execution completed
```

**Verification Points:**
- ‚úÖ Total steps: 13 (not 3 as before)
- ‚úÖ Each iteration shows: start ‚Üí access ‚Üí complete
- ‚úÖ Array access includes loop context
- ‚úÖ Loop completion shows iteration count

---

### **Scenario 2: Loop with Multiple Operations**
**Setup:**
- Start ‚Üí For Loop ‚Üí Array Access ‚Üí Array Highlight ‚Üí End
- Loop from 0 to 2
- Test array: [5, 15, 25]

**Expected Behavior:**
- Each iteration should show both array access AND highlight steps
- Loop context should be included in all operation descriptions
- Total steps should be: Start + Loop Start + (3 iterations √ó 3 steps) + Loop Complete + End = 13 steps

---

### **Scenario 3: Empty Loop**
**Setup:**
- For Loop with start = 5, end = 5 (no iterations)

**Expected Results:**
```
1. Starting algorithm execution
2. Starting loop: i = 5 to 5
3. Loop completed (no iterations)
4. Algorithm execution completed
```

---

### **Scenario 4: Single Iteration Loop**
**Setup:**
- For Loop with start = 0, end = 1
- Array access within loop

**Expected Results:**
- Should show single iteration with proper loop context
- No premature loop completion

## üîç **Manual Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Access Visual Scripting Editor**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Go to Data Customization Panel
3. Click "Visual Scripting" tab
4. Verify editor loads correctly

### **Step 2: Create Test Script**
1. Drag Start node to canvas
2. Drag For Loop node, set:
   - Start: 0
   - End: 3
   - Variable: i
3. Drag Array Access node
4. Drag End node
5. Connect nodes:
   - Start ‚Üí For Loop (execution)
   - For Loop ‚Üí Array Access (execution)
   - For Loop ‚Üí Array Access (index data)
   - For Loop ‚Üí End (completion)

### **Step 3: Execute and Verify**
1. Click "Run" button
2. Check browser console for step details
3. Verify step count and descriptions match expected results
4. Test animation controls (play/pause/step)

### **Step 4: Animation Verification**
1. Use step-by-step controls
2. Verify each step shows correct array highlighting
3. Confirm loop iterations are visually distinct
4. Check that array elements are highlighted correctly for each iteration

## üêõ **Debugging Checklist**

### **If Steps Are Still Missing:**
- [ ] Check console for execution errors
- [ ] Verify node connections are correct
- [ ] Confirm loop end value is greater than start
- [ ] Check that array access has proper index connection

### **If Loop Context Is Missing:**
- [ ] Verify loop stack is being maintained
- [ ] Check that loop variables are being set correctly
- [ ] Confirm metadata is being added to steps

### **If Animation Is Incorrect:**
- [ ] Check step metadata for indices array
- [ ] Verify array highlighting is working
- [ ] Confirm step actions are set correctly

---

## üìä **Performance Testing**

### **Large Loop Test:**
- Create loop with 50+ iterations
- Verify reasonable execution time (< 5 seconds)
- Check memory usage doesn't spike excessively
- Confirm all steps are generated correctly

### **Complex Script Test:**
- Create nested loops or multiple operations per iteration
- Verify step generation remains accurate
- Check for any performance degradation

---

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

The fix is successful if:

1. **Step Count**: Loop iterations generate multiple steps (not just 3 total)
2. **Step Content**: Each step includes proper loop context information
3. **Animation**: Visual highlighting works correctly for each iteration
4. **Performance**: Execution completes in reasonable time
5. **Accuracy**: Array access shows correct indices and values for each iteration

---

## üö® **Known Issues to Watch For**

1. **Infinite Loops**: Ensure loop end conditions are respected
2. **Memory Usage**: Large loops shouldn't cause memory issues
3. **Step Overflow**: Very large loops might need step limiting
4. **Nested Loops**: Complex nesting might need additional testing
